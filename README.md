# BankingApplication
A program for an online bank which comes with some features for both client and employees as withdraw and bank transfer.
Although in the end I managed to complete the assessment, in my opinion I found it as a whole rather difficult for the level we are at  this point. I had a lot of difficulty getting to complete all the processes and the initial time given to complete all the tasks was practically impossible to be delivered. Thankfully we had extensions so that everything could be completed, but I'm still not sure if I managed to do everything as requested. I still find it difficult to understand classes in general and I had to do a lot of research outside the classes and try to learn by myself, as the classes were quite complicated. Got very struggled to set up withdraw and make the application works with bank transfer but I think I did that well at the end. Even after completing the entire assessment I still feel unsure to do a project like this, but hopefully I will be learning everything in the near future.
